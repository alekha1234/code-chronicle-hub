# Code Chronicle Hub 🧠💻

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my programming studies, comprising detailed notes, illustrative code examples, and practical exercises that cover fundamental concepts and programming techniques. It is intended as a central hub for organizing and tracking my progress as I deepen my understanding of programming languages and related technologies.

## Current Focus

At present, this repository primarily contains materials related to C++ programming, including:

- Basic syntax and structure  
- Control flow constructs (conditionals, loops)  
- Patterns  
- Coming soon...
